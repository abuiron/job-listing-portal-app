# Job Apply Portal

This project is a comprehensive **Job Apply Portal** built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. It was developed during an internship at **Zidio Development Pvt Ltd**. The portal provides users with an interface to search and apply for jobs while allowing administrators to manage job listings and categories.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration functionality with role-based access (admin and user).
- **Job Listings:** Browse, search, and filter job listings based on job type, location, and salary.
- **Job Application:** Users can apply for jobs directly through the portal, with their application status tracked in the database.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Admins can create, update, and delete job listings and categories. They can also view job applications and manage user roles.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **MongoDB Integration:** All data is stored in a MongoDB database, with three main collections: `jobs`, `jobTypes`, and `users`.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main directories: `backend` and `frontend`.

- **Backend:** Handles the server-side logic, database interactions, and API endpoints. The backend is built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
- **Frontend:** Manages the client-side interface using React.js, with routing handled by React Router.
